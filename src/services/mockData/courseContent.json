For this tutorial, we'll build a \"Personal Task Manager\" app.\n\n**Step 2: Describe Your Requirements**\nWhen describing your app to Apper, be specific about:\n- What the app should do\n- Who will use it\n- Key features you need\n- How it should look and feel\n\n**Example Description:**\n\"I want to create a personal task manager where I can add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, due date, and priority level. I want to see my tasks in a clean list format and be able to mark them as complete.\"\n\n**Step 3: Let Apper Build**\nOnce you provide your description, Apper will:\n1. Analyze your requirements\n2. Design the user interface\n3. Create the data structure\n4. Implement the functionality\n5. Generate a working application\n\n**Step 4: Review and Refine**\nAfter Apper creates your app, you can:\n- Test all the features\n- Request modifications\n- Add new functionality\n- Customize the appearance\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n- Start simple and add complexity gradually\n- Be clear and specific in your descriptions\n- Don't hesitate to iterate and improve\n- Test your app thoroughly before sharing",
