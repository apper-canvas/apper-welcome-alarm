This module introduces evidence-based study strategies that incorporate interactive learning principles to maximize your learning outcomes.\n\nCore Study Strategies:\n\n1. Active Recall\n   - Testing yourself without looking at notes\n   - Using flashcards and spaced repetition\n   - Explaining concepts aloud or to others\n\n2. Spaced Repetition\n   - Reviewing material at increasing intervals\n   - Using apps like Anki or Quizlet\n   - Creating a review schedule\n\n3. Elaborative Interrogation\n   - Asking 'why' and 'how' questions\n   - Connecting new information to existing knowledge\n   - Creating analogies and examples\n\n4. Interleaving\n   - Mixing different topics in study sessions\n   - Avoiding blocking (studying one topic at a time)\n   - Enhancing transfer of learning\n\n5. Practice Testing\n   - Taking practice exams\n   - Creating your own test questions\n   - Using retrieval practice regularly\n\nImplementation Tips:\n- Start with short, focused study sessions\n- Use multiple senses (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)\n- Take regular breaks to maintain focus\n- Track your progress and adjust strategies as needed",
